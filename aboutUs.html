          <p class="text">Team leader. Lord of memes. Pedophile. Caldwell is our spiritual leader: without him
            we would be lost. As leader of the team, Caldwell's job is to make sure we are always on track. He is often seen napping
            on the floor, playing footsie with unwilling ladies, or skulking the hallways looking for kids. Many people have said good
            things about him: <i>"Get away from me creep!" "You sure are good with kids, wait, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY SON BRYCE"</i><br>
            All the team can say when asked about him: "class act."

            <p class="text"> Sacrifice. No not that kind, SACRIFICE! <i>"Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice!"</i> Luigi is found 
              always patrolling the hallways and marking his territory. His trusty spear, "Sir PierceALot," is always by his side 
              or thrown at unsuspecting prey. <br> <i>"I went to BCIT during my school field trip and this guy threw his spear at me.
              It hurt, but it was sick!" - recently deceased student.</i> <br> His favourite hobby is to dance around a fire yelling 
              "sacrifice" and can even be seen doing so in the back of the class. If there is a missing hoodie, laptop, or classmate, 
              you can be sure to find familiar ashes within the raging bonfire.

            <p class="text">Father. Papa. Courneya. If Caldwell is our spiritual leader then Bryce is his cheerleader. As the odd one
              out of the group, Bryce is always struggling to get along with his peers. From frosted tips to breaking his ankle, Bryce
              has done all in his power to have someone he can call friend. He looks up to Caldwell, someone who receives a great amount of
              attention, and is currently studying in his ways. In his desperate attempts to imitate him, he urges peers to call him papa or
              father, his new-found moniker. Only after threats and displays of nudity did peers unwillingly comply. As "father" of the group
              he is constantly making sure everyone is on track through ways no one could even imagine.

                  is shrouded in mystery. No one knows where he comes from or if he even goes to school at BCIT but rest assured, when 
                  that red hoodie comes bouncing along, no one is left standing in its path. He may be small in stature but don't underestimate
                  him or he'll show you why he is called "big boi."
